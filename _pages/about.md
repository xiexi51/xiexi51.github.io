## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/) since Fall 2022, advised by [Prof. Caiwen Ding](https://caiwending.github.io/web/home.html). I obtained my M.S. degree in Geophysics from the Institute of Geophysics, China Earthquake Administration, advised by [Prof. Zhongliang Wu](https://www.ief.ac.cn/222/info/2021/35094.html).

My research interests include high-performance GPU algorithm design and secure and trustworthy AI/ML systems. I am skilled in C++/CUDA programming and CUDA algorithm design, and I enjoy taking on challenges with official libraries. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
